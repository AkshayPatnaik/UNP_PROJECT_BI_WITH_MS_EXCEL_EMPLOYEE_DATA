# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_MS_EXCEL_EMPLOYEE_DATA
This project was developed as a group assignment under the guidance of UNP Education.
We analyzed a raw dataset to extract insights into demographic and employment characteristics.
The dataset underwent preprocessing, including data cleaning, column formatting, and categorical grouping.
Data analysis and visualization were carried out using Microsoft Excel.
Pivot tables and charts were used to summarize metrics such as occupation distribution, income types, asset ownership, and communication preferences.
A dashboard was created to present the insights in a clear and interactive format.
The project highlights skills in data cleaning, categorization, visualization, and reporting using Excel.
